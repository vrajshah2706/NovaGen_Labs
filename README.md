# NovaGen_Labs
Health Risk Detecting System where i built an end to end supervised ML pipeline using Logistic regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Support vector machine, Decision tree, Ensemble learning (bagging& boosting) to predict health outcome (healthy or unhealthy). Implemented binary classification along with EDA, feature engineering, model evaluation (precision, recall, accuracy, confusion matrix, OOB) to get the best model.
Evaluated all the models and came to a conclusion for deployment.
